        <h2>Master-detail and drawer navigation - XAM290</h2>
<p>Building a great application means creating clear navigation path through your content. As your application grows in complexity, you need to provide a UI structure that allows users to quickly switch between multiple screens. In this course, you'll explore two UI techniques using a master-detail relationship. You'll learn how to switch between several pages of content using drawer navigation, and you'll create a true master-detail UI that enables users to browse a large collection of data while taking advantage of available screen space. This course includes an in-depth look at the Xamarin.Forms MasterDetailPage and shows you best practices on coordinating between Master and Detail pages.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose between split and popover for your master view</li>
<li>Switch between pages using popover drawer navigation</li>
<li>Display a collection using master-detail split view</li>
</ul>
